# Stock Price Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the XGBoost model in predicting stock prices. It utilizes a historical dataset with stock prices and volumes to train the model. The analysis includes various data preprocessing steps, computation of technical indicators like moving averages, MACD, RSI, and time series decomposition.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- XGBoost for the prediction model
- Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation tools
- STLdecompose for time series decomposition
